**AI-Powered Business Insights Dashboard**
Retail Feedback Analytics with Python & Data Science

**Problem Statement**
Retail companies collect thousands of customer feedback entries daily, but raw feedback is often messy, unstructured, and hard to interpret. Without proper analysis, businesses struggle to:

Identify customer pain points
Understand sentiment (positive/negative/neutral)
Track product/service performance trends
Make data-driven decisions to improve growth

This project solves that by building an **AI-Powered Business Insights Dashboard** that converts raw retail feedback into **actionable insights**.

**Features**

 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – handle missing values, duplicates, outliers
 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA**) – visualizing key trends with Pandas, Matplotlib & Seaborn
 **Sentiment Analysis** – using NLP (VADER/TextBlob) to classify customer feedback
 **Interactive Dashboard** – visualize KPIs, customer satisfaction, and trends
 **Predictive Analytics** – forecast sales & sentiment trends

**Tech Stack**

**Programming:** Python 3
**Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
**NLP:** VADER / TextBlob
**Dashboarding**: Streamlit / Dash
**Version Control:** Git & GitHub
